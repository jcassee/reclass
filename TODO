reclass TODO
============

- Puppet adapter, whoever might want that…???
- Tests for outputters
- Improve testing of yaml_fs, maybe with more realistic examples
- Configurable file extension (.yaml/.yml, or support both)
- Remove applications_hosts, or factor it out to the Ansible adapter, as it's
  not really relevant to Salt or reclass in general. And remove 'groups' from
  the inventory return.
- Improve the adapters, either by just letting them build their own
  OptionParsers, or through setuptools entrypoints (probably best…). The
  reclass API would need a bit of generalisation for that to happen…
